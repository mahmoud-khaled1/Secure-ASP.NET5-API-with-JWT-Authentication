after create token when user register 
if we put [authorize] in any contoller or Action in controller 
noone can't access this contorller or Action untill client send the token to server 
to check it first 

----
note after user register the token is saved in client not in the server or DataBase 
and every time the user login just send the token to server and server take token and create new token again 
for this user and if the token that user send is match with the new one then user is safe .
